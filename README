This code is designed to work on text fields. It could easily be made to work on text areas by finding and replacing "val" with "text"

- add class of "placeholder" to the form object you would like to put a placeholder in.
- provide a "value" attribute in the object
- provide a "data-label" attribute in the object with the same value as "value"
